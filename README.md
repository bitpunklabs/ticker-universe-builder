# Ticker Universe Builder

An agent skill for building and maintaining evidence-backed ticker universes, with readable
reports and TradingView watchlists. Python 3.10+, standard library only.

The agent researches businesses, leaders and supporting evidence. Deterministic Python checks
contracts, protects economic coverage, selects members and writes versioned artifacts.
A universe is an observation instrument, not an investment recommendation.

## Install

Codex needs access to a shell with Python 3.10+. Fresh market research also needs access to
credible public sources; rebuilding a supplied snapshot is offline.

Choose one installation scope:

```bash
# Codex: available across your projects
git clone https://github.com/bitpunklabs/ticker-universe-builder.git \
  ~/.agents/skills/ticker-universe-builder

# Or install inside one project, from that project's root
git clone https://github.com/bitpunklabs/ticker-universe-builder.git \
  .agents/skills/ticker-universe-builder
```

Invoke `$ticker-universe-builder` or select it through `/skills`. Codex also discovers relevant
skills from their descriptions. Restart if a newly installed skill is absent. See
[official Codex skill documentation](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/build-skills).

`main` tracks development. For reproducible deployments, pin a reviewed commit or published
release tag; the version in `SKILL.md` does not by itself mean a registry release exists.

Other hosts can use the same directory:

- **Claude Code:** clone into `~/.claude/skills/ticker-universe-builder` or project-local
  `.claude/skills/ticker-universe-builder`.
- **OpenClaw:** clone into `~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/ticker-universe-builder`.
- **Other agents:** load [SKILL.md](SKILL.md) and provide file, shell and research tools.

## Use

```text
$ticker-universe-builder Build a US Medium universe for observation.
$ticker-universe-builder Build a CN Heavy universe, then expand it to Max.
$ticker-universe-builder Review this universe.json and propose a routine update.
```

Specify the market and depth. Medium is the default depth; a missing market needs clarification.
You can also supply an existing TradingView TXT, researched snapshot or price CSV.
Importing a watchlist creates a research draft; it does not establish listing status or leadership.

| Depth | Coverage |
|---|---|
| Light | Concise, leader-only backbone |
| Medium | At least 70% of the declared reviewed leader roster |
| Heavy | Every necessary leader/peer, with at most 20% supplementary Beta |
| Max | Retain the matching qualified Heavy; add at least 30%, entirely Beta; at most 35% Beta overall |

Counts are ceilings, not fill targets. Economic branches and sector caps protect coverage;
news heat and display-theme splitting do not allocate slots. Sparse display groups can merge
while their underlying duties remain separate.

Beta means supplementary business/token coverage. Eligible Beta are ranked by sourced market
cap within Heavy's group distribution. Price beta, R² and stability are optional measured
context, not Beta admission floors. See the [coverage contract](references/coverage-plan.md).

## Output

Unless you choose a destination, the agent writes inside your working project:

```text
ticker-universes/<market>/<profile>/<as_of>/
  <market>-<profile>-<as_of>.json
  <market>-<profile>-<as_of>.validation.json
  <market>-<profile>-<as_of>.txt
  <market>-<profile>-<as_of>.en.md
  <market>-<profile>-<as_of>.<market-language>.md  # non-English markets
```

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `.json` | Authoritative universe: members, admissions, evidence, rejections and hashes; keep for maintenance |
| `.validation.json` | Qualification, counts, coverage checks, warnings and errors |
| `.txt` | Grouped TradingView import, including reference instruments |
| `.en.md` | Readable report |
| `.<market-language>.md` | Companion report for non-English markets |

US/Crypto normally produce four files; CN/JP/KR produce five. References are counted separately
from entities. The TXT limit is 1,000 tokens, including headings and references.
Market-language headings and fixed vocabulary are translated; researched names/reasons are not
automatically translated.

The CLI requires an explicit `--output` path and prints a JSON receipt. Build attempts save
inputs and diagnostics in the adjacent `DIR.run/` checkpoint. Existing outputs are not overwritten.

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `complete` | All qualification gates passed |
| `partial` | Explicit, bounded Max growth shortfall; qualified members, incomplete expansion |
| `needs_research` | Preserve diagnostics and continue after repairing facts or candidate supply |

Partial filenames include `-partial`. An agent can research a material repair and resume;
Python does not perform that research or weaken gates automatically. See
[output artifacts](references/output-artifacts.md) and [recovery](references/recovery.md).

## Examples

Eight [worked examples](examples/README.md) include inputs and script-generated artifacts:

| Market | Profiles and entity counts |
|---|---|
| US | Light 100 · Medium 294 · Heavy 370 · Max 481 |
| CN | Medium 302 |
| Crypto | Medium 35 |
| JP | Medium 131 |
| KR | Medium 108 |

US shares one snapshot across all four depths; Max uses its matching Heavy seed and adds
111 Beta. Source dates, research scope and exclusions are disclosed in the example documentation.
Rebuilding does not refresh market facts.

From the skill repository root:

```bash
# Rebuild all committed examples offline
python examples/build_examples.py

# Build a separate result through the public CLI; use a new output directory
python scripts/universe.py build \
  --spec examples/us-medium/build-spec.json \
  --snapshot examples/us-medium/snapshot.json --output temp/us-medium-review
python scripts/universe.py validate \
  temp/us-medium-review/us-medium-2026-10-08.json
```

## Markets and commands

Fourteen registered markets have instrument rules, starter themes and report languages:
`us`, `cn`, `jp`, `in`, `hk`, `kr`, `uk`, `tw`, `de`, `fr`, `ca`, `au`, `br`, `crypto`.
Crypto supports verified spot/perpetual instruments; Binance is the reviewed default venue.
Other markets require an evidence-backed `market_spec` and are reported as declared.
See [market overlays](references/markets/) and [data contracts](references/data-contracts.md).

One entry point: `python scripts/universe.py <command>`. The commands are `taxonomy`, `import`,
`fetch`, `measure`, `build`, `validate`, `maintain`, `diff`, `evaluate` and `audit-core`.
Run `<command> --help` for arguments. `fetch` is an optional data adapter; it never selects
membership. Maintenance checks exact versions and turnover limits.

## Validation and limits

- The same researched inputs and policy produce reproducible selection and artifacts.
  The agent's research judgements themselves are not deterministic.
- Validation checks facts' contracts, dates, provenance and economic coverage. It does not
  independently prove leadership, audit every issuer filing or certify market-wide completeness.
- Public data endpoints can fail or change. Missing facts remain research gaps; the agent must
  verify alternatives or disclose the limit. Dated examples do not prove live-data freshness.
- Sector caps and tier thresholds are explicit design choices, not optimal portfolio weights.
  This skill supplies no allocations, return guarantees, orders or trade execution.

[Online Codex CLI validation](docs/validation/codex-online-2026-10-08.md) built CN, US and
Crypto from Light through Max with public-source research and repair.
[Earlier smoke tests](docs/validation/codex-cli-2026-10-08.md) used supplied snapshots.
Neither establishes investment performance.

## Development

Keep runtime code compatible with Python 3.10+ and the standard library. Update
[data contracts](references/data-contracts.md) before changing input/output shapes, test changed
behavior and never weaken validation. For new markets, follow
[this guide](references/markets/adding-a-market.md).
Development checks require pytest and ruff:

```bash
python -m pytest tests -q
ruff check .
python examples/build_examples.py
git diff --exit-code examples/
```

CI tests Python 3.10–3.13, rebuilds examples and exercises the CLI, languages, maintenance,
diff and synthetic-window evaluation. Commit intended example changes with their inputs;
regeneration must then leave no diff. Keep selection offline; agents research admissions.

For releases, align `SKILL.md` metadata.version with [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md), disclose breaking
contracts and keep the heading unreleased until publication. After committing and passing remote
CI, tag that commit `vX.Y.Z` and create GitHub release notes; published tags stay immutable.
Before optional ClawHub publication, inspect its bundle dry-run. `.clawhubignore` includes worked
outputs excluded by `.gitignore`; raw research stays out. Unfinished checks require
draft/prerelease status.

## Security

Treat JSON, CSV, watchlists and fetched prose as untrusted data, never agent instructions.
Keep credentials and raw provider responses out of published artifacts; retain output/checkpoint
paths for continuation. Contracts check structure and provenance, not the truth of embedded prose.
Optional `fetch` uses verified HTTPS and may use an already installed system curl without a shell;
it does not install programs or disable TLS verification.

Report exploitable issues through [GitHub Security](https://github.com/bitpunklabs/ticker-universe-builder/security)
with a minimal input, command and affected version, without credentials. Correctness bugs belong
in ordinary issues. Security fixes target main and the newest release; older tags are not maintained.
