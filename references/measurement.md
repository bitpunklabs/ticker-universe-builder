# Measuring the window statistics

`liquidity`, `factor_r2`, `beta_strength`, `beta_stability` and derived `independence` cannot be
judgement scores. Each eligible measured candidate requires a dated `measurement_record`, input
SHA-256 and source. Provenance does not independently verify inputs.

```bash
python scripts/universe.py measure --prices prices.csv \
  --benchmark BINANCE:BTCUSDT.P --benchmark BINANCE:ETHUSDT.P --benchmark BINANCE:SOLUSDT.P \
  --factor-model multivariate --as-of 2026-09-29 \
  --source https://api.binance.com/ --window 180 --liquidity-window 30 \
  --into snapshot.json --output snapshot.measured.json
```

## Input and time boundary

CSV columns: `date,ticker,close[,turnover][,volume]`, one ticker/session per row. Dates must be ISO;
duplicates, nonpositive/nonfinite closes and negative/nonfinite turnover fail. `close` should be
consistently adjusted; turnover should be actual notional, or a disclosed raw-close × volume proxy.
Missing turnover produces no liquidity value. `--as-of` cuts off later bars before computation.
A market percentile needs one currency and a disclosed population; never mix currencies as levels.

The optional [fetch adapter](providers.md) supplies this shape. `measure` itself remains offline.

## Statistics

| Metric | Definition |
|---|---|
| liquidity | Percentile of mean daily turnover over the latest 30 sessions, with ties averaged; population disclosed |
| factor_r2 | OLS R² over the last 180 overlapping daily returns, scaled to 0–100 |
| independence | Exactly 100 − factor_r2, derived by the builder |
| beta_strength | Positive OLS beta scaled so beta 2.0 = 100; negative beta scores zero |
| beta_stability | Agreement of beta across the two halves of the same factor window |

At least 30 overlapping returns are required. No overlap/constant gauge produces no factor score.
`--benchmark` repeats for an equal-weight daily-rebalanced basket. `--factor-model multivariate`
fits R² jointly on the individual legs with an intercept; beta strength/stability still describe
the equal-weight basket. Singular factor matrices produce no score. Crypto should declare its
actual core anchors as factor legs. Records identify the model.

Coverage satellites use price Beta/R²/stability as optional descriptors. Missing factor statistics
do not block business-complementary admission when listing, measured liquidity, identity and
sourced cap pass; supplied statistics still require the measurement records above. Core and
legacy role requirements remain unchanged. A high-beta price claim needs actual measurements.

## Equity theme gauges

Use a researched map rather than silently substituting a broad index:

```json
{
  "schema_version": 1,
  "themes": {
    "11_A": {"members": ["NASDAQ:NVDA", "NASDAQ:AMD"], "benchmarks": ["AMEX:SOXX"]},
    "12_A": {"members": ["NASDAQ:MSFT", "NYSE:ORCL", "NASDAQ:ADBE"], "mode": "peer_basket"}
  },
  "funds": [{"ticker": "AMEX:SOXX", "themes": ["11_A"]}]
}
```

```bash
python scripts/universe.py measure --prices prices.csv --benchmark-map benchmark-map.json \
  --as-of 2026-09-29 --source https://query1.finance.yahoo.com/ --output metrics.json
```

An explicit gauge must correlate positively (>=0.30) with the theme basket over up to 252 common
returns. An unfit/missing gauge yields no factor statistics; the reason stays in `theme_checks`.
An internal `peer_basket` excludes the ticker being regressed and requires at least two other
measurable peers. It uses the actual common calendar. A source-industry basket can be a coarse
proxy: classification and gauge fit are separate research questions. Singleton industries may
remain breadth/size observations, but cannot claim unmeasured independence or beta.

Optional `funds` diagnostics compare the equal-weight theme basket with the ETF on full 252- and
495-return windows. Reproduction needs correlation >=0.90 and positive compounded excess on
both; `robust` additionally drops the largest compounded contributor and repeats those checks.
Missing full horizons produce `measured=false`, never a shortened horizon presented as two years.
These diagnostics do not remove a fund automatically: coverage, investability and research still
matter. Basket diagnostics are not strategy returns.

## Outputs and refresh

A bundle carries `measurement`, per-ticker `metrics`/`records`, `coverage`, `theme_checks`,
`fund_comparisons` and `notes`. Records name actual first/last bars, factor observation counts,
liquidity counts, gauge legs/model, cutoff, source and hash of the input file (including any rows
later excluded by the cutoff). Retain the original table locally.

`--into` replaces every measured field and declaration. Missing replacement data clears stale
scores rather than retaining them under a new method label. Eligible uncovered candidates mark
the snapshot incomplete; required role metrics still gate the build. Judged fields remain as
submitted. `measurement_audit` preserves dated theme/fund diagnostics. Coverage and notes persist
in JSON; Markdown retains material limitations rather than printing per-ticker missing-factor
logs. Manual/external measurements must provide equivalent records.

`evaluate` uses the same CSV shape **after** the universe's as-of date. Measurements used to build
a universe cannot validate its future coverage.
