# Continue an interrupted or underfilled build

`build` keeps an append-only attempt history in `OUTPUT.run/run.json` by default. Use
`--run-dir PATH` to choose another checkpoint directory. Each attempt archives the exact spec,
snapshot, resolved policy and seed, their combined SHA-256, diagnostics and artifact paths.
The run index is updated atomically. Use a single writer per checkpoint.

| Exit | Status | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | `complete` | All quality gates passed, including Max growth of at least 40%; unused capacity above the minimum is allowed (legacy replay: count filled) |
| 2 | `needs_research` | Input, coverage, seed or output error prevented publication |
| 3 | `partial` | Disclosed valid subset: near-target Max growth gap, or legacy below-size replay |

For coverage-first, resolve necessary representatives and Core decisions before optional depth.
The Max handler has two outcomes. `shortfall_action: auto` is the default; `deliver` explicitly
requests the same delivery branch, while `retry` always requires full growth. CLI
`--shortfall-action` overrides the spec and is saved on resume.

- **Deliver:** the only unmet requirement is growth; deficit is at most 5% of required total
  entities, positive Beta growth, and all other checks pass. Emit `partial` (exit 3), explicit
  actual/required counts, growth and deficit, `qualified: false`, `-partial` filenames, and a
  continuation. For Heavy 457, minimum 640, selected 613: deficit 27/640=4.22%, so deliver.
  Planned group ceilings remain frozen; empty places are not transferred.
- **Analyze and retry:** larger gaps, invalid facts or explicit retry choice yield
  `needs_research` (exit 2). Diagnostics distinguish candidate supply, group distribution, and
  other constraints. Review gauges/assignments, target deficient groups, use another verified
  source, then resume with materially changed inputs. Python does not run network research
  or relax gates automatically. A disclosed threshold-policy change needs methodological
  justification and uniform remeasurement; it must not cherry-pick members or fit.

Current R²>=30, beta strength>=55 (approximately positive beta>=1.1) and stability>=50 stay
unchanged. Candidate size alone is not proof of a high-beta price response. Lowering strength
to 50 (approximately beta>=1.0) would redefine the intended price exposure and needs a
separately disclosed policy; identity, listing, measured data and core coverage stay mandatory.
The error/receipt and `diagnostics.expansion` show proposed capacity before remaining caps;
`diagnostics.recovery` lists deficient groups and research strategies. Outside Max growth,
target-fill diagnostics apply to legacy replay only.
Read the diagnostic for every intermediate tier, not just the first missing theme. Capacity
counts are upper bounds, not promises: duplicate assets, mandatory members and token limits can
still constrain selection. A 1,000-token ceiling is a real boundary; never hide a target reduction.

The agent owns the research loop; the Python selector is deliberately offline:

1. For transient provider failure, repeat `fetch` in the same data directory. Its same-day,
   exact-request cache retains successful responses; transient HTTP/network errors already have
   three request attempts. Inspect exclusions separately from transport failures.
2. For missing economic branches/representatives, repair that research or verify another source.
   Unused capacity above Max's growth minimum does not require expansion. In legacy replay, missing themes/counts
   may instead require a broader verified bench.
   Repair missing listing/provenance facts, and rerun `measure` on the changed data. Preserve
   verified candidates and disclose scope exclusions. Do not reinterpret a missing quote as a
   delisting, or invent a theme, metric or classification just to fill a slot.
3. Continue with the command printed in `resume_command`, for example:

   ```bash
   python scripts/universe.py build --resume output.run --snapshot snapshot.repaired.json
   ```

   Paths omitted on resume retain their original values. Changing the file at the saved path is
   also supported. Unchanged inputs return the last outcome without spending another attempt;
   a run interrupted while `running` may retry those inputs. Completed earlier outputs are kept.
   Later artifacts go in `RUN_DIR/attempt-NNN/artifacts`, unless `--output` names a new empty path.
4. Normally try up to three distinct repair rounds. Record what changed and why in the snapshot
   notes. Do not run three identical failing commands. A research bench smaller than the target is not a source capacity ceiling. Check fetched but
   unmapped candidates and alternative verified sources first. When Heavy and Max contain
   identical members, disclose zero expansion and continue classification research; regenerating
   identical snapshots is not a repair round. A proven source capacity ceiling, an
   unavailable required input or the user's budget can end the loop sooner. Return a valid
   partial subset only with its actual count, requested count, missing work and checkpoint.

Resuming does not guarantee more eligible assets exist. Do not call a partial Max complete,
silently substitute Heavy, or broaden the user's market/venue scope without disclosing it.
This workflow adds local receipts, not an agent runtime or automatic network research in `build`.

Syntax errors or unreadable initial input files must be fixed before the first build attempt can
be archived. Existing output directories are never overwritten. A continuation requiring a new
output path may pass `--output` explicitly.
