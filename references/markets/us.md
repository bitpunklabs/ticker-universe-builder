# US overlay

Read [equity-common.md](equity-common.md) first: the universe boundary, the fund-versus-
basket redundancy test, the cash-management exclusion and the rule about regressing
against the theme rather than the index are the same in every equity market.

## Universe boundary

- Common stock and the ETFs needed as gauges. Warrants, rights, units, preferred shares and shell
  SPACs are excluded by default.
- Confirm the TradingView venue, an active listing and sufficient turnover.
- Flag ADRs. Never treat two securities of one economic entity as two information sources.

## Build focus

- Light is leader-only; Medium covers most reviewed leaders; Heavy completes all necessary
  leaders and differentiated peers before a small measured satellite tail. Max adds only
  qualified satellites to the same Heavy. Use the shared [coverage contract](../coverage-plan.md).
- Compare at the old Core's observation budget, and reconcile every original instrument.
  Recent heat, display-theme count and market-cap rank alone cannot define representation.
- Preserve US-listed foreign businesses when in scope. Review banking business models,
  underwriting versus brokerage, software functions, drug/device roles, parcel logistics,
  regulated utilities and consumer formats. Toys/IP do not count as household-care coverage.
- Measure against the appropriate sector/theme ETF, not SPY; a bad gauge does not justify
  dropping a necessary representative.

## Cash-management instruments

Money-market, ultra-short and cash-management funds are the ones that win every US liquidity
ranking and carry no signal. They are excluded by instrument type — see equity-common.md.

## US economic map

The US starter follows the legacy map: AI hardware/semiconductors, platforms, data-center
infrastructure and software remain distinct. Payments, credit, banking, insurance and market
infrastructure are different business models. Separate regulated utilities, merchant power,
fuel and equipment; separate REIT operating exposures. Include eligible ADRs after identity
research; a provider's primary-listing flag is not a reason to erase US-listed foreign exposure.

Review functional lookalikes: [UiPath](https://www.uipath.com/product) automates software
workflows, not physical robots; [Recursion](https://www.recursion.com/pipeline) has a drug
development pipeline, not just diagnostic tools. Separate automakers from retail, payment
processors from card networks, and mixed storage-property exposures from pure data centers.
Keep these as evidence-backed research decisions, not permanent ticker rules in Python.

Market/macro, funds and commodity-underlying observation are separate duties from company
exposure. The standard equity adapter does not fetch all these automatically. Research the
missing gauges explicitly; a verified listed ETF may serve a declared proxy duty, but disclose
tracking/basis differences and do not invent an unsupported index/CFD symbol. Cash substitutes
remain excluded; duration, currency and commodity signals require actual observable movement.

## Adverse flags

| Code | What it is |
|---|---|
| `late_filing` | An NT 10-K or NT 10-Q, or a filing past its extended deadline |
| `listing_deficiency` | An exchange deficiency notice: price, market value, float or governance |
| `material_weakness` | A disclosed material weakness in internal control over financial reporting |

## Example

[`examples/us-medium/`](../../examples/us-medium/) contains a full-size Medium
research snapshot, measured statistics, dated listing evidence, reports and script-generated watchlist.
Read [the scope and limitations](../../examples/README.md) before reusing it.

## Suggested live fields

- Listing and quote status, 20 / 60-day dollar turnover.
- Beta, downside beta, R², excess return, volatility and max drawdown against the theme's own ETF.
- Beta stability across 63 / 126 / 252 days.
- Sector-appropriate quality fields, not one threshold applied across every industry.
- Earnings dates, company filings or ETF holdings as evidence.

Public sector classifications routinely place companies with entirely different drivers in one
bucket. When the classification is ambiguous, map ticker by ticker and record the reason; never let
a wrong sector label decide the theme.
