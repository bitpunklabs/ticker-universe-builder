"""Measure a universe after the fact, from a price table covering the window it lived through.

Every threshold in this skill is a guess. The guidance ranges, `BETA_FULL_SCALE`, the
listing-age bands, the score weights, the breadth factors, the theme weights — all set by
judgement, and none of them has ever been checked against an outcome. That is the largest gap in
the design, and it is worse for a declared market, whose numbers were invented at run time by an
agent rather than judged once by a person.

This is not a backtest and does not produce one. A universe is an observation instrument, not a
portfolio, so the question is never "what did it return" — it is whether the instrument saw what
happened. Every section below is tied to one constant it would recalibrate:

| Section | Recalibrates |
|---|---|
| `survival` | the freshness window and the review cadence |
| `coverage` | the per-market guidance ranges — was the universe wide enough to see the move |
| `rejections` | the eligibility rules, by exclusion code |
| `themes` | the theme `weight`s — whether the taxonomy is weighted where the moves were |
| `metrics` | `SCORE_WEIGHTS` — which metric actually ordered anything |
| `independence` | the declared factor redundancy against the realised one |

Reads the same CSV `measure` does. Standard library only.
